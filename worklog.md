Task: Read codebase and diagnose all issues

Work Log:
- Read render-snake-atlas.tsx (822 lines) — found eye tracking, boost effects, custom skin rendering
- Read input.ts — found mouse angle calculation using viewport center
- Read SnakeGame.tsx — found skin resolution using getPlayerSkinAsset/getPlayerSkinId
- Read skin-registry.ts — confirmed getPlayerSkinId returns 'custom-lab-skin' from localStorage
- Read engine.ts — confirmed snake.skinId set correctly from skinOverride
- Read cosmetics-shop.tsx (908 lines) — found complex 3-tab + 7-filter UI
- Read try-on-preview.tsx — found preview with fixed-forward eyes
- Read skin-preview-game.tsx — found preview eyes not tracking mouse
- Read cosmetics-section.tsx — found face cosmetics panel
- Read face-cosmetics.ts — found CosmeticDrawParams type and renderEquippedCosmetics

Stage Summary:
- ROOT CAUSE 1: Custom lab skin gets atlas built, so atlas renderer used → atlas renderer has no shape/taper/glow code
- ROOT CAUSE 2: Eyes use snake.targetAngle which converges to snake.angle (turn-rate limited) → pupils always look forward
- ROOT CAUSE 3: Preview eyes are drawn at fixed offset, don't track mouse
- ROOT CAUSE 4: Shop has 3 tabs + 7 category filters + 4-step lab jargon = confusing

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main
Task: Fix custom skin not equipping in-game

Work Log:
- Modified renderSnakeAtlas() to redirect 'custom-lab-skin' to fallback renderer
- Fallback renderer has shape/taper/glow code at lines 556-567
- Also added mouseScreenX/mouseScreenY parameters for eye tracking

Stage Summary:
- Custom lab skins now correctly use fallback renderer with shapes, taper, and glow
- File: src/components/game/render-snake-atlas.tsx

Task ID: 3
Agent: Main
Task: Fix ultra-responsive eyes

Work Log:
- Updated drawResponsiveEyes() to accept mouseScreenX/mouseScreenY parameters
- Changed eye tracking from snake.targetAngle (converges to snake.angle) to raw mouse position
- Pupils now track mouse cursor directly with 0.7 * eyeRadius shift (edge of socket)
- Falls back to targetAngle when mouse position unavailable
- Updated both atlas and fallback renderer paths to pass mouse position
- Updated SnakeGame.tsx to get mouse position via input.getMousePos() and pass to renderers
- Updated CosmeticsDrawParams interface to include mouseScreenX/mouseScreenY
- Updated GameSkinPreview to track mouse and make preview eyes responsive

Stage Summary:
- Eyes now track mouse cursor directly — even tiny movements cause visible pupil shifts
- Files: render-snake-atlas.tsx, SnakeGame.tsx, face-cosmetics.ts, skin-preview-game.tsx

Work Log:
- Updated skin-preview-game.tsx to track mouse position via mousemove event

Stage Summary:
- Preview now has same eye positioning and tracking as in-game
- File: src/components/panels/cosmetics/skin-preview-game.tsx
